# Bouncing-Balls
2D graphical balls bouncing around by hitting the edges

## Requirements
Python 3.6  
pygame library  
#### If running balls.exe
no requirements

## Instructions
#### The following can be changed by modifying the settings.json:
- window resolution
- number of balls
- radius(in pixels) of balls, can be random for each ball in a specified range
- initial movement direction, can be set to random
- speed of balls, can be random for each ball in a specified range
- color[R,G,B], can be set to random
- fps(it changes speed of balls(since speed of balls is defined as pixels per fram))
#### There are a few preset json settings files in the "other_settings" folder. They must be put in main directory and renamed to "settings.json" to work.
#### Just when closing the window a screenshot is saved("pic.png") in the directory. Thats how the pictures below are made.
### Examples:
#### By default there is only one black ball bouncing around
